tags: dinner

recipeYield: 6 servings

ingredients:
- 1 box of linguine noodles
- 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
- 6 Cloves minced Garlic
- 1/2 Cup Chicken Broth
- 1/4 Cup white wine
- 1 juiced lemon
- 1/2 Teaspoon lemon zest
- Salt to taste
- 2 Teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 Pound peeled and deveined shrimp
- 1/4 Cup butter
- 3 Tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh Basil

directions:
- Boil large pot of lightly salted water. Add linguine, and cook for 9-13 minutes until al dente; drain.
- Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and saute garlic about 1 minute. Mix in chicken broth, wine, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat, and simmer until liquid is reduced by about 1/2.
- Mix shrimp, butter, parsley, and basil into the saucepan. Cook 2-3 minutes, until shrimp is opaque. Stir in the cooked linguine, and continue cooking 2 minutes, until well coated.
- I leave out the cooking wine and substitute chicken broth and it tastes great. I also use more chicken broth than the recipe calls for. I like more sauce.
